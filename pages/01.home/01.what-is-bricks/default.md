<p>Bricks is MyOnlineStore's design system. It contains a large set of principles, rules, components and other resources for MyOnlineStore developers, designers and all other employees. Also 3rd party developers and companies can use the information in this system to create beautiful and consistent products.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">- A design system isn&rsquo;t a project. It&rsquo;s a product serving products.</em></p>
<p><em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">- A design system isn&rsquo;t a standard carved in stone, nor is it a one-time deliverable. It&rsquo;s the heart of your product development process, not an artifact of the process.</em></p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1cb74vid60">Always ready and never done</h3>
<p>This design system is a living entity. Since we created the system as a MVP (minimal viable product) some subjects or elements will be missing or incomplete. Also web trends will change, technology will advance and the world economy also changes a lot. Therefor the product needs to be able to change and so does the design system. We try to put as much information in it as possible and to keep up to date with everybodies needs. Do you want to add or change something? Contact <a title="Mail Johan" href="mailto:johan@myonlinestore.com">Johan</a> or <a title="Mail Luuk" href="mailto:luuk@myonlinestore.com">Luuk</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Consistancy is the main reason that started the creation of this reference.</p>
