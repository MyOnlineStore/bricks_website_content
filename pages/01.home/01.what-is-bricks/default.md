<p>Bricks is MyOnlineStore's design system. It contains a large set of principles, rules, components and other resources for MyOnlineStore developers, designers and all other employees. Also 3rd party developers and companies can use the information in this system to create beautiful and consistent products.</p>
<p>A few quotes from <a href="https://medium.com/@marcintreder/design-systems-sprint-0-the-silver-bullet-of-product-development-8c0ed83bf00d">Marcin Treder's articles on design systems</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">&nbsp;A design system isn&rsquo;t a project. It&rsquo;s a product serving products.</em></p>
<p><em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">&nbsp;A design system isn&rsquo;t a standard carved in stone, nor is it a one-time deliverable. It&rsquo;s the heart of your product development process, not an artifact of the process.</em></p>
<p><em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">A design system is the architectural core of a product(s) for ensuring design and code consistency and product development efficiency.</em></p>
<p><em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">Software is often built by incredibly large teams of people. The challenge to create coherent experiences multiplies exponentially as more people are added to the mix. Over time, no matter how consistent or small a team is, different people will contribute new solutions and styles, causing experiences to diverge.</em></p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1cb74vid60">Always ready and never done</h3>
<p>This design system is a living entity. Since we created the system as a MVP (minimal viable product) some subjects or elements will be missing or incomplete. Also web trends will change, technology will advance and the world economy also changes a lot. Therefor the product needs to be able to change and so does the design system. We try to put as much information in it as possible and to keep up to date with everybodies needs. Do you want to add or change something?

<h3 id="mcetoc_1cad59q391">Consistancy</h3>
<p>Consistancy is the main reason that started the creation of this reference. While this design system offers a reasonable amount of flexibilty, we want to emphasize the importance of consistancy. It is achieved by creating &aacute;nd following clear rules about the look and feel of our products and expressions.</p>
