<p>MyOnlineStore's key values describe the four keywords that we think are the heart of each of our products. They can help you when creating content or developing MyOnlineStore products.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="mcetoc_1cavnq92d2">Simple</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gemakkelijk --&gt; Effortless, Easy-to-use </span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep it simple</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone should be able to turn their idea into an online store without the need for any coding, (e-)commerce or design experience. At the same time experienced entrepreneurs should be able to run a successful online business with little effort. Every product of MyOnlineStore is designed to be very easy to set-up and maintain, empowering the experienced without overwhelming the inexperienced. </span></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="mcetoc_1cavnqbg03">Real</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Persoonlijk --&gt; Personal, Merchants first Keep it real</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always be aware of the &lsquo;real world&rsquo;. Know who your merchants and their customers are, what drives them and talk to them often. Use research whenever possible to be able to identify and support each decision and its effect on real merchants. Stay up-to-date about what goes on in their world and design things that really matter to them ahead of the curve. </span></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="mcetoc_1cavnq3k71">Fresh</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plezierig --&gt; Fun, Enjoyable Fun/Delight/Wow/Aha/ Wow-effect Keep it fresh</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with the simplest user interface, running an online store can sometimes be a tedious task. To combat this we implement subtle &lsquo;Wow&rsquo;-moments in our design. Moments that make you smile. Moments that make it feel like Christmas morning. Moments that can break an otherwise monotonous routine.</span></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="mcetoc_1cavnq1eo0">Efficient</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Keep it Consistent but Flexible Keep it efficient</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bricks is all about flexible consistency. It focuses on building coherent reusable bricks rather than big monolithic structures. Individual bricks can easily be combined to form structures more rapidly. They are interchangeable and provide flexible building blocks for every department&rsquo;s needs. Bricks fit together as one and ensure consistency for the brand while maintaining flexibility. </span></p>
