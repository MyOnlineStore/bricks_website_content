<p><img class="right" src="logos/logo-construction.png" alt="" width="300" />This is our primary logo this is also the preferred version. The two color green on a white or light background. Generally the logo will be in our two color green but occasionally it can be a in a single color green or a secondary color. This has to be the 100% color and not a shade, gradiant or any other colors.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1canomoj10">Logo Icon Construction</h2>
<p>As you can see our logo icon is carefuly constructed and based on symetry. The rounded corners give it a soft edge and meet a similarity in the fonts we use.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1canoncec1">Logo Icon Color</h2>
<p><img class="right" src="logos/beeldmerk-colors.png" alt="" width="400" height="358" />Notice that the pieces fit together like a puzzle. This represents the smooth overlap between working together and helping our costumers realise and therefor achieve their dreams. To accentuate this idea we use a slight color difference between the two halfs.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="mcetoc_1canopsg00">Logo Exclusion Zone</h2>
<p><img class="right" src="logos/logo-exclusion-zone.png" alt="" width="516" height="284" />We&rsquo;ve defined an exclusion zone of 50% of the height of the icon. This space prevents other graphic elements interfering with our logo. Use the 50% as a guideline, exceptions are permitted of course.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="mcetoc_1canplnd11">Logo Minimal Sizing</h2>
<p><img class="right" src="logos/Screen Shot 2018-04-03 at 13.25.49.png" alt="" width="445" height="73" />Please don&rsquo;t use the logo any smaller than 10 mm or 20 pixels. We want our audience able to read our logo. When scaling be sure that proportions stay in shape and sizing is always done in height.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="mcetoc_1canptin50">Logo color and background</h2>
<p><img src="logos/logo-color-combos.png" alt="" width="600" height="599" /></p>
<p>Our logo may be applied in full color, black and white, and on reversed background colors only. Plain color backgrounds are preferred. The logo (and icon ownly) can be placed on a photographic background; however, it is imperative that there is su icient contrast between the two elements. And that the all white logo is used.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="mcetoc_1canq2h340">Try to use the right logo file for the job.</h2>
<p>When using our logo on a dark background, it&rsquo;s important you use the right file. We&rsquo;ve constructed specific logo files to prevent the optical illusion of the lines of our logo being thicker than they actually are. So don&rsquo;t just change the colors.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1canq2sab1">Secondary logo use and guidelines.</h2>
<p><img class="right" src="logos/secondary logo.png" alt="" width="594" height="241" />Usualy we feel it&rsquo;s not really necessary to comunicate the url extension, but if you feel the need, please use the url include logo files. Take notice of the correct place and size of the extansion. All guidelines, sizes and margin rules are the same as the original.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="mcetoc_1canq9fq30">Please try to avoid incorrect logo usses</h2>
<p><img class="right" src="logos/bevel and emboss.png" alt="" />We can devote a whole book of do not do this to our logo, but since we gave you our trust and we value your judgement we&rsquo;re not going to. We have a few guidelines and we feel like it&rsquo;s unnecessary to point out the obvious. Please treat our logo with the same respect you would yours, so don&rsquo;t shade, scale, fade, twist, turn, flip, rotate, stretch, crop or adjust our logo in any way.</p>
<p><em>One other thing.. don&rsquo;t use bevel and emboss.</em></p>
